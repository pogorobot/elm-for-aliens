### Chapter 0: Elm is for Aliens

Rails is for zombies, I learned.

That's the most popular tutorial's name: Rails for Zombies. 

And it kind of describes the Rails Way, where even a mindless automaton should be able to throw up a functional CRUD app within fifteen minutes.

However, by Sapir-Worff, I can't help but feel that the longer I work in Rails, I find myself slowly becoming a zombie.

I don't want to try new things.

I don't want to slow down and think about my design.

I want to chase the next feature request, the next bugfix, the next shiny object -- whatever will satisfy my hunger.

Being a zombie doesn't feel very good.

I want my tools to push me -- to challenge me.

I want to aspire to greatness.

Or, at least, to strangeness.

Elm is for aliens.

It does not follow Earth logic, with your "objects" and your "attributes" and your "mutable data".

It follows a universal logic.

An elegant logic.

It will help you see what you're doing through strange eyes.
